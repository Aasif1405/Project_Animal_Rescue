Hi Professor, 

I am Aasif, and this is final semester. I want to be full stack developer. This is the reason why I have dropped this course and again retaken for this semester. Last Semester I have worked on a lot of concepts like SPA, Ajax, TS, Mongodb, etc. I hope this semester goes well and I can learn a lot of new things. So, the purpose of the repository is the develope my knowledge through out commits and which helps me to carry along with the real world
